Be sure to adhere to these instructions. IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.\n\nContents of /app/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Repository Purpose\n\nThis repository contains a C++ implementation of the quicksort algorithm applied to singly-linked lists. It serves as an educational example demonstrating:\n- How to implement quicksort on linked list data structures\n- In-place partitioning without random access\n- Recursive sorting with pointer manipulation\n\n## Code Architecture\n\n**Single-file implementation**: `quick_sort_linked_list.cpp`\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **ListNode structure** (lines 4-9)\n   - Simple singly-linked list node with integer values\n   - Contains `val` and `next` pointer\n\n2. **Helper Functions**\n   - `printList()` (lines 12-21): Displays链表 in readable format\n   - `getTail()` (lines 24-29): Finds the tail node for pivot selection\n   - `createList()` (lines 106-120): Creates链表 from array\n   - `freeList()` (lines 123-129): Memory cleanup\n\n3. **Core Algorithm**\n   - `partition()` (lines 32-67): Lomuto partition scheme adapted for链表\n   - `quickSortRec()` (lines 70-98): Recursive quicksort implementation\n   - `quickSort()` (lines 101-103): Entry point with tail node detection\n\n4. **Test Cases** (lines 131-217)\n   - 5 comprehensive test scenarios in `main()`\n   - Tests: random arrays, sorted arrays, reverse arrays, duplicates\n\n## Common Commands\n\n### Build and Run\n```bash\n# Compile the program\ng++ -std=c++17 -o quick_sort quick_sort_linked_list.cpp\n\n# Run the executable\n./quick_sort\n\n# One-liner: compile and run\ng++ -std=c++17 -o quick_sort quick_sort_linked_list.cpp && ./quick_sort\n```\n\n### Development Notes\n\n- **C++ Standard**: Requires C++17 or later\n- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (iostream, random)\n- **No test framework**: Self-contained tests in `main()`\n- **No linting tools configured**: Manual code review recommended\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Algorithm Characteristics\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case\n- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for recursion stack\n- **Partition Strategy**: Uses tail node as pivot\n- **Stability**: Not stable (relative order of equal elements not preserved)\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n- Pivot selection: Always uses the tail node of the current sub链表\n- In-place reordering without creating new链表 nodes\n- Handles edge cases: empty链表, single element, all equal elements\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\n/Users/guangnian/code/demo_claude/\n├── quick_sort_linked_list.cpp    # Source code (220 lines)\n├── quick_sort                    # Compiled executable\n└── CLAUDE.md                     # This file\n```\n\n### User Constraints\nDo not use emoji\n\nNo additional directories, build configurations, or documentation files exist.\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.\n</system-reminder>\n"}, {"type": "text", "text": "我是一个刚学编程的新手，请用最友好、最生动有趣的方式帮我解释一下这个项目中的 partition 函数是怎么工作的，生成一个文档说明一下", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}], "system": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK.", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}, {"type": "text", "text": "\nYou are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Claude Code (eg. \"can Claude Code do...\", \"does Claude Code have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Claude Code in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Claude Code (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or install an MCP server)\n- how to use the Claude Agent SDK, or asks you to write code that uses the Claude Agent SDK\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide' to get accurate information from the official Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read. If a user asks about or wants you to modify a file, read it first. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- \n- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it.\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.\n  - Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.\n  - Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.\n  - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task—three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.\n- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused `_vars`, re-exporting types, adding `// removed` comments for removed code, etc. If something is unused, delete it completely.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: Read for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, Edit for editing instead of sed/awk, and Write for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n\nYou can use the following tools without requiring user approval: Bash(pip install:*), Bash(python3 -m pip install:*), Bash(apt-get update:*), Bash(apt-get install:*), Bash(python3:*), Bash(curl:*), Bash(wget:*)\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /app\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.0-94-generic\nToday's date: 2025-12-27\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4.5. The exact model ID is claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929.\n\nAssistant knowledge cutoff is January 2025.\n\n<claude_background_info>\nThe most recent frontier Claude model is Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model ID: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929').\n</claude_background_info>\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}], "tools": [{"name": "Task", "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n- Plan: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"description": {"type": "string", "description": "A short (3-5 word) description of the task"}, "prompt": {"type": "string", "description": "The task for the agent to perform"}, "subagent_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of specialized agent to use for this task"}, "model": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sonnet", "opus", "haiku"], "description": "Optional model to use for this agent.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend.  ONLY use --amend when either (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook (additional instructions below) \n- Before amending: ALWAYS check authorship (git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry ONCE. If it succeeds but files were modified by the hook, verify it's safe to amend:\n   - Check authorship: git log -1 --format='%an %ae'\n   - Check not pushed: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\"\n   - If both true: amend your commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit (never amend other developers' commits)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can thoroughly explore the codebase and design an implementation approach.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\nUse EnterPlanMode when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways, each with trade-offs\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n2. **Significant Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between architectural patterns\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n3. **Large-Scale Changes**: The task touches many files or systems\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Migrate from REST to GraphQL\"\n\n4. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n5. **User Input Needed**: You'll need to ask clarifying questions before starting\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, consider EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nDo NOT use EnterPlanMode for:\n- Simple, straightforward tasks with obvious implementation\n- Small bug fixes where the solution is clear\n- Adding a single function or small feature\n- Tasks you're already confident how to implement\n- Research-only tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- This requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- Be thoughtful about when to use it - unnecessary plan mode slows down simple tasks\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of starting implementation\n- You can always ask the user \"Would you like me to plan this out first?\"\n", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": false, "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "max_tokens": 32000, "metadata": {}}, "response_body": {"content": [{"type": "thinking", "thinking": "用户希望我用友好、生动有趣的方式解释 partition 函数的工作原理，并生成一个文档。\n\n首先，我需要读取代码文件来了解 partition 函数的具体实现。\n\n根据 CLAUDE.md，partition 函数在 lines 32-67，文件是 quick_sort_linked_list.cpp。\n\n用户说\"不要用emoji\"，所以我需要避免使用任何表情符号。\n\n让我先读取文件，然后用友好易懂的方式解释这个函数。"}, {"type": "text", "text": "我来帮你理解 partition 函数！首先让我读取一下代码，然后用最容易理解的方式为你解释。"}, {"type": "tool_use", "id": "toolu_012aaDQi7XaJr5WnojBeUMQB", "name": "Read", "input": {"file_path": "/app/quick_sort_linked_list.cpp"}}]}}

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Claude Code (eg. \"can Claude Code do...\", \"does Claude Code have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Claude Code in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Claude Code (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or install an MCP server)\n- how to use the Claude Agent SDK, or asks you to write code that uses the Claude Agent SDK\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide' to get accurate information from the official Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read. If a user asks about or wants you to modify a file, read it first. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- \n- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it.\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.\n  - Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.\n  - Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.\n  - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task—three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.\n- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused `_vars`, re-exporting types, adding `// removed` comments for removed code, etc. If something is unused, delete it completely.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: Read for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, Edit for editing instead of sed/awk, and Write for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n\nYou can use the following tools without requiring user approval: Bash(pip install:*), Bash(python3 -m pip install:*), Bash(apt-get update:*), Bash(apt-get install:*), Bash(python3:*), Bash(curl:*), Bash(wget:*)\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /app\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.0-94-generic\nToday's date: 2025-12-27\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4.5.

Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}], "tools": [{"name": "Task", "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n- Plan: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"description": {"type": "string", "description": "A short (3-5 word) description of the task"}, "prompt": {"type": "string", "description": "The task for the agent to perform"}, "subagent_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of specialized agent to use for this task"}, "model": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sonnet", "opus", "haiku"], "description": "Optional model to use for this agent.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend.  ONLY use --amend when either (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook (additional instructions below) \n- Before amending: ALWAYS check authorship (git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry ONCE. If it succeeds but files were modified by the hook, verify it's safe to amend:\n   - Check authorship: git log -1 --format='%an %ae'\n   - Check not pushed: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\"\n   - If both true: amend your commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit (never amend other developers' commits)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- This requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- Be thoughtful about when to use it - unnecessary plan mode slows down simple tasks\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of starting implementation\n- You can always ask the user \"Would you like me to plan this out first?\"\n", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": false, "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "max_tokens": 32000, "metadata": {}}, "response_body": {"content": [{"type": "thinking", "thinking": "好的，我已经看到了 partition 函数的代码。现在我需要用非常友好、生动的方式来解释这个函数。让我为新手编写一个容易理解的文档。\n\npartition 函数的核心思想是把链表分成两部分：小于 pivot 的节点放前面，大于等于 pivot 的节点放后面。\n\n我会创建一个新的 markdown 文档，使用比喻、图解和分步骤的方式来解释。记住，用户要求不要使用 emoji。\n\n让我写一个详细的、友好的文档。"}, {"type": "text", "text": "好的！我来为你创建一个超级友好的文档，用最生动的方式解释 partition 函数。我会用比喻和分步骤的方式，让你轻松理解。"}, {"type": "tool_use", "id": "toolu_018GCE6SCstj5t1HLBrcdc99", "name": "Write", "input": {"file_path": "/app/partition函数详解.md", "content": "# partition 函数详解 - 给编程新手的友好指南\n\n## 欢迎！让我们一起理解这个神奇的函数\n\n你好呀！作为编程新手，看到一堆指针和循环可能会觉得头晕。别担心，我会用最简单的方式帮你理解 partition 函数是怎么工作的。\n\n---\n\n## 首先，什么是 partition（分区）？\n\n想象一下你在整理一排小朋友：\n- 你选择最右边的小朋友作为\"标准\"（我们叫他 pivot，枢轴）\n- 然后把比他矮的小朋友都排到左边\n- 把比他高或一样高的小朋友都排到右边\n- 最后这个\"标准\"小朋友就站在中间合适的位置\n\n这就是 partition 做的事情！只不过我们整理的不是小朋友，而是链表中的数字节点。\n\n---\n\n## 函数签名解读\n\n```cpp\nListNode* partition(ListNode* head, ListNode* end, ListNode** newHead, ListNode** newEnd)\n```\n\n让我们看看这些参数是什么：\n\n- `head`：要整理的链表的开始节点（第一个小朋友）\n- `end`：要整理的链表的结束节点（最后一个小朋友，也是我们的标准）\n- `newHead`：整理完后，新链表的开始位置会存在这里\n- `newEnd`：整理完后，新链表的结束位置会存在这里\n- 返回值：返回 pivot（那个作为标准的节点）\n\n---\n\n## 核心思想：两个队伍\n\npartition 函数会把节点分成两个队伍：\n\n**队伍A（小于区）**：所有值 < pivot 的节点\n**队伍B（大于等于区）**：所有值 >= pivot 的节点\n\n最后的样子是：`[队伍A] -> [pivot] -> [队伍B]`\n\n---\n\n## 代码逐行解析\n\n### 第一步：初始化变量（准备工作）\n\n```cpp\nListNode* pivot = end;        // pivot 是我们的标准（最后一个节点）\nListNode* prev = nullptr;     // 记录前一个节点（就像手拉手排队，记住前面的人）\nListNode* cur = head;         // 当前正在检查的节点\nListNode* tail = pivot;       // tail 记录\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n```\n\n想象一下：\n- pivot：站在最后的\"标准小朋友\"\n- cur：我们的\"检查员\"，从第一个小朋友开始逐个检查\n- prev：记住\"小于区\"的最后一个人\n- tail：记住\"大于等于区\"的最后一个人\n\n### 第二步：主循环（开始整理）\n\n```cpp\nwhile (cur != pivot) {\n    // 检查每个节点，直到遇到 pivot 为止\n}\n```\n\n我们从头到尾检查每个节点（但不包括 pivot 本身）。\n\n### 第三步：分类处理\n\n#### 情况1：当前节点 < pivot（比标准小）\n\n```cpp\nif (cur->val < pivot->val) {\n    // 当前节点小于 pivot，留在前面\n    if (*newHead == nullptr) {\n        *newHead = cur;

   // 记录新链表的尾巴\nreturn pivot;      // 返回 pivot 的位置\n```\n\n整理完毕！把新链表的结束位置告诉调用者，并返回 pivot。\n\n---\n\n## 完整示例：一步一步看整个过程\n\n假设我们有这样一个链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5`\n\n**初始状态：**\n- pivot = 5（最后一个节点）\n- 我们要把所有 < 5 的放前面，>= 5 的放后面\n\n**处理过程：**\n\n1. **检查节点 3**（值 < 5）\n   - 3 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - newHead = 3\n   - 链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5`\n\n2. **检查节点 7**（值 >= 5）\n   - 7 比 5 大，拔出来放到 pivot 后面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7`\n\n3. **检查节点 2**（值 < 5）\n   - 2 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7`\n\n4. **检查节点 9**（值 >= 5）\n   - 9 比 5 大，拔出来放到最后面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n5. **检查节点 1**（值 < 5）\n   - 1 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n**最终结果：**\n`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n小于 5 的在前面（3, 2, 1），5 在中间，大于等于 5 的在后面（7, 9）。\n完美！\n\n---\n\n## 关键理解点\n\n### 1. 为什么用指针的指针（`ListNode**`）？\n\n因为我们需要修改 `newHead` 和 `newEnd` 的值，并让调用者能看到这些修改。\n\n**简单类比：**\n- 普通指针（`ListNode*`）：给你一张纸的副本，你在副本上写字，原件不变\n- 指针的指针（`ListNode**`）：给你原件，你直接在原件上写字，调用者能看到\n\n### 2. 为什么要记录 `prev`？\n\n因为链表是单向的（只能往前走，不能回头）。当我们要把一个节点拔出来时，必须知道它前面那个节点是谁，这样才能重新连接链表。\n\n**就像火车车厢：**\n如果要拿走中间的一节车厢，你得知道前一节在哪里，才能把前后重新连起来。\n\n### 3. 为什么 partition 很重要？\n\npartition 是快速排序（QuickSort）的核心步骤！\n- 第一次 partition 后，pivot 就在正确位置了\n- 然后递归地对 pivot 左边和右边分别再做 partition\n- 不断重复，直到整个链表有序\n\n---\n\n## 动画演示（用文字模拟）\n\n初始链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]`（5 是 pivot）\n\n```\n步骤1：检查 3\n[3] -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]\n      ↑ cur\n3 < 5，保持不动\n\n步骤2：检查 7\n3 -> [7] -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]\n      ↑ cur\n7 >= 5，移到后面！\n3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n\n步骤3：检查 2\n3 -> [2] -> 9 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n      ↑ cur\n2 < 5，保持不动\n\n步骤4：检查 9\n3 -> 2 -> [9] -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n           ↑ cur\n9 >= 5，移到后面！\n3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n\n步骤5：检查 1\n3 -> 2 -> [1] -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n           ↑ cur\n1 < 5，保持不动\n\n完成！\n最终：3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n      小于区      pivot  大于等于区\n```\n\n---\n\n## 小测验：检验你的理解\n\n**问题1：** 如果链表是 `5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 5`，pivot 是最后的 5，partition 后是什么样子？\n\n<details>\n<summary>点击查看答案</summary>\n\n答案：`3 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8` 或 `3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5`\n\n解释：\n- 第一个 5（值等于 pivot）会被移到后面，因为代码是 `>=`\n- 3 比 5 小，留在前面\n- 8 比 5 大，移到后面\n</details>\n\n**问题2：** 为什么要用 `tail` 来记录\"大于等于区\"的尾巴？\n\n<details>\n<summary>点击查看答案</summary>\n\n答案：因为当我们要把一个节点移到\"大于等于区\"时，需要把它接到这个区域的最后面。`tail` 就是帮我们快速找到最后面在哪里，避免每次都从头遍历。\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## 总结：核心思想\n\npartition 函数就像一个\"智能分类机器\"：\n\n1. **选择标准**：最后一个节点是 pivot\n2. **逐个检查**：从头到尾检查每个节点\n3. **两种操作**：\n   - 节点 < pivot：留在原地（或者说在\"小于区\"）\n   - 节点 >= pivot：拔出来放到\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n4. **完成**：所有小的在前，pivot 在中间，所有大的在后\n\n---\n\n## 下一步学习建议\n\n如果你想更深入理解：\n\n1. **手动模拟**：拿张纸画出链表，手动模拟几个例子\n2. **添加打印**：在代码里加 `std::cout`，看每一步的变化\n3. **尝试修改**：试着改变 pivot 的选择方式（比如选第一个而不是最后一个）\n4. **理解递归**：学习 partition 之后，看看 `quickSortRec` 函数如何递归调用\n\n---\n\n## 最后的鼓励\n\n链表和指针是 C++ 中比较难的概念，如果一开始不理解，完全正常！多读几遍，多画几个图，多运行几次程序，慢慢就会有\"啊哈！\"的顿悟时刻。\n\n编程是一项需要练习的技能，就像学骑自行车，刚开始可能会摔倒，但只要坚持，一定能掌握！\n\n加油！你已经在学习的道路上迈出了重要的一步。\n"}}]}}

Be sure to adhere to these instructions. IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.\n\nContents of /app/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Repository Purpose\n\nThis repository contains a C++ implementation of the quicksort algorithm applied to singly-linked lists. It serves as an educational example demonstrating:\n- How to implement quicksort on linked list data structures\n- In-place partitioning without random access\n- Recursive sorting with pointer manipulation\n\n## Code Architecture\n\n**Single-file implementation**: `quick_sort_linked_list.cpp`\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **ListNode structure** (lines 4-9)\n   - Simple singly-linked list node with integer values\n   - Contains `val` and `next` pointer\n\n2. **Helper Functions**\n   - `printList()` (lines 12-21): Displays链表 in readable format\n   - `getTail()` (lines 24-29): Finds the tail node for pivot selection\n   - `createList()` (lines 106-120): Creates链表 from array\n   - `freeList()` (lines 123-129): Memory cleanup\n\n3. **Core Algorithm**\n   - `partition()` (lines 32-67): Lomuto partition scheme adapted for链表\n   - `quickSortRec()` (lines 70-98): Recursive quicksort implementation\n   - `quickSort()` (lines 101-103): Entry point with tail node detection\n\n4. **Test Cases** (lines 131-217)\n   - 5 comprehensive test scenarios in `main()`\n   - Tests: random arrays, sorted arrays, reverse arrays, duplicates\n\n## Common Commands\n\n### Build and Run\n```bash\n# Compile the program\ng++ -std=c++17 -o quick_sort quick_sort_linked_list.cpp\n\n# Run the executable\n./quick_sort\n\n# One-liner: compile and run\ng++ -std=c++17 -o quick_sort quick_sort_linked_list.cpp && ./quick_sort\n```\n\n### Development Notes\n\n- **C++ Standard**: Requires C++17 or later\n- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (iostream, random)\n- **No test framework**: Self-contained tests in `main()`\n- **No linting tools configured**: Manual code review recommended\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Algorithm Characteristics\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case\n- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for recursion stack\n- **Partition Strategy**: Uses tail node as pivot\n- **Stability**: Not stable (relative order of equal elements not preserved)\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n- Pivot selection: Always uses the tail node of the current sub链表\n- In-place reordering without creating new链表 nodes\n- Handles edge cases: empty链表, single element, all equal elements\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\n/Users/guangnian/code/demo_claude/\n├── quick_sort_linked_list.cpp    # Source code (220 lines)\n├── quick_sort                    # Compiled executable\n└── CLAUDE.md                     # This file\n```\n\n### User Constraints\nDo not use emoji\n\nNo additional directories, build configurations, or documentation files exist.\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks.

       // pivot 是我们的标准（最后一个节点）\nListNode* prev = nullptr;     // 记录前一个节点（就像手拉手排队，记住前面的人）\nListNode* cur = head;         // 当前正在检查的节点\nListNode* tail = pivot;       // tail 记录\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n```\n\n想象一下：\n- pivot：站在最后的\"标准小朋友\"\n- cur：我们的\"检查员\"，从第一个小朋友开始逐个检查\n- prev：记住\"小于区\"的最后一个人\n- tail：记住\"大于等于区\"的最后一个人\n\n### 第二步：主循环（开始整理）\n\n```cpp\nwhile (cur != pivot) {\n    // 检查每个节点，直到遇到 pivot 为止\n}\n```\n\n我们从头到尾检查每个节点（但不包括 pivot 本身）。\n\n### 第三步：分类处理\n\n#### 情况1：当前节点 < pivot（比标准小）\n\n```cpp\nif (cur->val < pivot->val) {\n    // 当前节点小于 pivot，留在前面\n    if (*newHead == nullptr) {\n        *newHead = cur;       // 如果是第一个小节点，它就是新链表的头\n    }\n    prev = cur;               // 更新\"小于区\"的尾巴\n    cur = cur->next;          // 继续检查下一个\n}\n```\n\n**发生了什么？**\n- 如果节点的值比 pivot 小，我们很开心，因为它本来就该在前面\n- 如果这是第一个小节点，它就成为新链表的开头\n- 然后我们继续往前走\n\n**打个比方：**\n标准身高是 50，现在检查到一个身高 30 的小朋友：\n\"太好了！你比标准矮，就站在这里别动。\" 然后我们去检查下一个。\n\n#### 情况2：当前节点 >= pivot（比标准大或相等）\n\n```cpp\nelse {\n    // 当前节点大于等于 pivot，需要移到后面\n    if (prev) {\n        prev->next = cur->next;

   // 记录新链表的尾巴\nreturn pivot;      // 返回 pivot 的位置\n```\n\n整理完毕！把新链表的结束位置告诉调用者，并返回 pivot。\n\n---\n\n## 完整示例：一步一步看整个过程\n\n假设我们有这样一个链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5`\n\n**初始状态：**\n- pivot = 5（最后一个节点）\n- 我们要把所有 < 5 的放前面，>= 5 的放后面\n\n**处理过程：**\n\n1. **检查节点 3**（值 < 5）\n   - 3 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - newHead = 3\n   - 链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5`\n\n2. **检查节点 7**（值 >= 5）\n   - 7 比 5 大，拔出来放到 pivot 后面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7`\n\n3. **检查节点 2**（值 < 5）\n   - 2 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7`\n\n4. **检查节点 9**（值 >= 5）\n   - 9 比 5 大，拔出来放到最后面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n5. **检查节点 1**（值 < 5）\n   - 1 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n**最终结果：**\n`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n小于 5 的在前面（3, 2, 1），5 在中间，大于等于 5 的在后面（7, 9）。\n完美！\n\n---\n\n## 关键理解点\n\n### 1. 为什么用指针的指针（`ListNode**`）？\n\n因为我们需要修改 `newHead` 和 `newEnd` 的值，并让调用者能看到这些修改。\n\n**简单类比：**\n- 普通指针（`ListNode*`）：给你一张纸的副本，你在副本上写字，原件不变\n- 指针的指针（`ListNode**`）：给你原件，你直接在原件上写字，调用者能看到\n\n### 2. 为什么要记录 `prev`？\n\n因为链表是单向的（只能往前走，不能回头）。当我们要把一个节点拔出来时，必须知道它前面那个节点是谁，这样才能重新连接链表。\n\n**就像火车车厢：**\n如果要拿走中间的一节车厢，你得知道前一节在哪里，才能把前后重新连起来。\n\n### 3. 为什么 partition 很重要？\n\npartition 是快速排序（QuickSort）的核心步骤！\n- 第一次 partition 后，pivot 就在正确位置了\n- 然后递归地对 pivot 左边和右边分别再做 partition\n- 不断重复，直到整个链表有序\n\n---\n\n## 动画演示（用文字模拟）\n\n初始链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]`（5 是 pivot）\n\n```\n步骤1：检查 3\n[3] -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]\n      ↑ cur\n3 < 5，保持不动\n\n步骤2：检查 7\n3 -> [7] -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]\n      ↑ cur\n7 >= 5，移到后面！\n3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n\n步骤3：检查 2\n3 -> [2] -> 9 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n      ↑ cur\n2 < 5，保持不动\n\n步骤4：检查 9\n3 -> 2 -> [9] -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n           ↑ cur\n9 >= 5，移到后面！\n3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n\n步骤5：检查 1\n3 -> 2 -> [1] -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n           ↑ cur\n1 < 5，保持不动\n\n完成！\n最终：3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n      小于区      pivot  大于等于区\n```\n\n---\n\n## 小测验：检验你的理解\n\n**问题1：** 如果链表是 `5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 5`，pivot 是最后的 5，partition 后是什么样子？\n\n<details>\n<summary>点击查看答案</summary>\n\n答案：`3 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8` 或 `3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5`\n\n解释：\n- 第一个 5（值等于 pivot）会被移到后面，因为代码是 `>=`\n- 3 比 5 小，留在前面\n- 8 比 5 大，移到后面\n</details>\n\n**问题2：** 为什么要用 `tail` 来记录\"大于等于区\"的尾巴？\n\n<details>\n<summary>点击查看答案</summary>\n\n答案：因为当我们要把一个节点移到\"大于等于区\"时，需要把它接到这个区域的最后面。`tail` 就是帮我们快速找到最后面在哪里，避免每次都从头遍历。\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## 总结：核心思想\n\npartition 函数就像一个\"智能分类机器\"：\n\n1. **选择标准**：最后一个节点是 pivot\n2. **逐个检查**：从头到尾检查每个节点\n3. **两种操作**：\n   - 节点 < pivot：留在原地（或者说在\"小于区\"）\n   - 节点 >= pivot：拔出来放到\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n4. **完成**：所有小的在前，pivot 在中间，所有大的在后\n\n---\n\n## 下一步学习建议\n\n如果你想更深入理解：\n\n1. **手动模拟**：拿张纸画出链表，手动模拟几个例子\n2. **添加打印**：在代码里加 `std::cout`，看每一步的变化\n3. **尝试修改**：试着改变 pivot 的选择方式（比如选第一个而不是最后一个）\n4. **理解递归**：学习 partition 之后，看看 `quickSortRec` 函数如何递归调用\n\n---\n\n## 最后的鼓励\n\n链表和指针是 C++ 中比较难的概念，如果一开始不理解，完全正常！多读几遍，多画几个图，多运行几次程序，慢慢就会有\"啊哈！\"的顿悟时刻。\n\n编程是一项需要练习的技能，就像学骑自行车，刚开始可能会摔倒，但只要坚持，一定能掌握！\n\n加油！你已经在学习的道路上迈出了重要的一步。\n"}, "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "tool_result", "content": "Claude requested permissions to write to /app/partition函数详解.md, but you haven't granted it yet.", "is_error": true, "tool_use_id": "toolu_018GCE6SCstj5t1HLBrcdc99", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}]}], "system": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a Claude agent, built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK.", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}, {"type": "text", "text": "\nYou are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Claude Code (eg. \"can Claude Code do...\", \"does Claude Code have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Claude Code in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Claude Code (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or install an MCP server)\n- how to use the Claude Agent SDK, or asks you to write code that uses the Claude Agent SDK\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide' to get accurate information from the official Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read. If a user asks about or wants you to modify a file, read it first. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- \n- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it.\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.\n  - Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.\n  - Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.\n  - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task—three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.\n- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused `_vars`, re-exporting types, adding `// removed` comments for removed code, etc. If something is unused, delete it completely.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: Read for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, Edit for editing instead of sed/awk, and Write for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n\nYou can use the following tools without requiring user approval: Bash(pip install:*), Bash(python3 -m pip install:*), Bash(apt-get update:*), Bash(apt-get install:*), Bash(python3:*), Bash(curl:*), Bash(wget:*)\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /app\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.0-94-generic\nToday's date: 2025-12-27\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4.5.

Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}], "tools": [{"name": "Task", "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n- Plan: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"description": {"type": "string", "description": "A short (3-5 word) description of the task"}, "prompt": {"type": "string", "description": "The task for the agent to perform"}, "subagent_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of specialized agent to use for this task"}, "model": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sonnet", "opus", "haiku"], "description": "Optional model to use for this agent.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend.  ONLY use --amend when either (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook (additional instructions below) \n- Before amending: ALWAYS check authorship (git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry ONCE. If it succeeds but files were modified by the hook, verify it's safe to amend:\n   - Check authorship: git log -1 --format='%an %ae'\n   - Check not pushed: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\"\n   - If both true: amend your commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit (never amend other developers' commits)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully.

       // pivot 是我们的标准（最后一个节点）\nListNode* prev = nullptr;     // 记录前一个节点（就像手拉手排队，记住前面的人）\nListNode* cur = head;         // 当前正在检查的节点\nListNode* tail = pivot;       // tail 记录\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n```\n\n想象一下：\n- pivot：站在最后的\"标准小朋友\"\n- cur：我们的\"检查员\"，从第一个小朋友开始逐个检查\n- prev：记住\"小于区\"的最后一个人\n- tail：记住\"大于等于区\"的最后一个人\n\n### 第二步：主循环（开始整理）\n\n```cpp\nwhile (cur != pivot) {\n    // 检查每个节点，直到遇到 pivot 为止\n}\n```\n\n我们从头到尾检查每个节点（但不包括 pivot 本身）。\n\n### 第三步：分类处理\n\n#### 情况1：当前节点 < pivot（比标准小）\n\n```cpp\nif (cur->val < pivot->val) {\n    // 当前节点小于 pivot，留在前面\n    if (*newHead == nullptr) {\n        *newHead = cur;       // 如果是第一个小节点，它就是新链表的头\n    }\n    prev = cur;               // 更新\"小于区\"的尾巴\n    cur = cur->next;          // 继续检查下一个\n}\n```\n\n**发生了什么？**\n- 如果节点的值比 pivot 小，我们很开心，因为它本来就该在前面\n- 如果这是第一个小节点，它就成为新链表的开头\n- 然后我们继续往前走\n\n**打个比方：**\n标准身高是 50，现在检查到一个身高 30 的小朋友：\n\"太好了！你比标准矮，就站在这里别动。\" 然后我们去检查下一个。\n\n#### 情况2：当前节点 >= pivot（比标准大或相等）\n\n```cpp\nelse {\n    // 当前节点大于等于 pivot，需要移到后面\n    if (prev) {\n        prev->next = cur->next;   // 把当前节点从原位置\"拔出来\"\n    }\n    ListNode* temp = cur->next;   // 先记住下一个要检查的节点\n    cur->next = nullptr;          // 切断当前节点的连接\n    tail->next = cur;             // 把当前节点接到\"大于等于区\"的尾巴后面\n    tail = cur;                   // 更新\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n    cur = temp;                   // 继续检查下一个\n}\n```\n\n**发生了什么？**\n1. 把节点从原来的位置\"拔出来\"（断开连接）\n2. 把它接到\"大于等于区\"的最后面\n3. 继续检查下一个节点\n\n**打个比方：**\n标准身高是 50，现在检查到一个身高 80 的小朋友：\n\"哎呀！你比标准高，不能站这里。来，去后面排队。\"\n然后把这个小朋友拉到队伍最后面。\n\n### 第四步：处理特殊情况\n\n```cpp\n// 如果 pivot 是最小的元素\nif (*newHead == nullptr) {\n    *newHead = pivot;\n}\n```\n\n**什么意思？**\n如果所有节点都比 pivot 大，那\"小于区\"就是空的。这时候 pivot 自己就是新链表的开头。\n\n**打个比方：**\n如果标准小朋友是最矮的，那所有人都比他高，他就自然站在最前面。\n\n### 第五步：收尾\n\n```cpp\n*newEnd = tail;    // 记录新链表的尾巴\nreturn pivot;      // 返回 pivot 的位置\n```\n\n整理完毕！把新链表的结束位置告诉调用者，并返回 pivot。\n\n---\n\n## 完整示例：一步一步看整个过程\n\n假设我们有这样一个链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5`\n\n**初始状态：**\n- pivot = 5（最后一个节点）\n- 我们要把所有 < 5 的放前面，>= 5 的放后面\n\n**处理过程：**\n\n1. **检查节点 3**（值 < 5）\n   - 3 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - newHead = 3\n   - 链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5`\n\n2. **检查节点 7**（值 >= 5）\n   - 7 比 5 大，拔出来放到 pivot 后面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7`\n\n3. **检查节点 2**（值 < 5）\n   - 2 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7`\n\n4. **检查节点 9**（值 >= 5）\n   - 9 比 5 大，拔出来放到最后面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n5. **检查节点 1**（值 < 5）\n   - 1 比 5 小，留在前面\n   - 链表：`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n**最终结果：**\n`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9`\n\n小于 5 的在前面（3, 2, 1），5 在中间，大于等于 5 的在后面（7, 9）。\n完美！\n\n---\n\n## 关键理解点\n\n### 1. 为什么用指针的指针（`ListNode**`）？\n\n因为我们需要修改 `newHead` 和 `newEnd` 的值，并让调用者能看到这些修改。\n\n**简单类比：**\n- 普通指针（`ListNode*`）：给你一张纸的副本，你在副本上写字，原件不变\n- 指针的指针（`ListNode**`）：给你原件，你直接在原件上写字，调用者能看到\n\n### 2. 为什么要记录 `prev`？\n\n因为链表是单向的（只能往前走，不能回头）。当我们要把一个节点拔出来时，必须知道它前面那个节点是谁，这样才能重新连接链表。\n\n**就像火车车厢：**\n如果要拿走中间的一节车厢，你得知道前一节在哪里，才能把前后重新连起来。\n\n### 3. 为什么 partition 很重要？\n\npartition 是快速排序（QuickSort）的核心步骤！\n- 第一次 partition 后，pivot 就在正确位置了\n- 然后递归地对 pivot 左边和右边分别再做 partition\n- 不断重复，直到整个链表有序\n\n---\n\n## 动画演示（用文字模拟）\n\n初始链表：`3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]`（5 是 pivot）\n\n```\n步骤1：检查 3\n[3] -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]\n      ↑ cur\n3 < 5，保持不动\n\n步骤2：检查 7\n3 -> [7] -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5]\n      ↑ cur\n7 >= 5，移到后面！\n3 -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n\n步骤3：检查 2\n3 -> [2] -> 9 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n      ↑ cur\n2 < 5，保持不动\n\n步骤4：检查 9\n3 -> 2 -> [9] -> 1 -> [5] -> 7\n           ↑ cur\n9 >= 5，移到后面！\n3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n\n步骤5：检查 1\n3 -> 2 -> [1] -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n           ↑ cur\n1 < 5，保持不动\n\n完成！\n最终：3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [5] -> 7 -> 9\n      小于区      pivot  大于等于区\n```\n\n---\n\n## 小测验：检验你的理解\n\n**问题1：** 如果链表是 `5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 5`，pivot 是最后的 5，partition 后是什么样子？\n\n<details>\n<summary>点击查看答案</summary>\n\n答案：`3 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8` 或 `3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5`\n\n解释：\n- 第一个 5（值等于 pivot）会被移到后面，因为代码是 `>=`\n- 3 比 5 小，留在前面\n- 8 比 5 大，移到后面\n</details>\n\n**问题2：** 为什么要用 `tail` 来记录\"大于等于区\"的尾巴？\n\n<details>\n<summary>点击查看答案</summary>\n\n答案：因为当我们要把一个节点移到\"大于等于区\"时，需要把它接到这个区域的最后面。`tail` 就是帮我们快速找到最后面在哪里，避免每次都从头遍历。\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## 总结：核心思想\n\npartition 函数就像一个\"智能分类机器\"：\n\n1. **选择标准**：最后一个节点是 pivot\n2. **逐个检查**：从头到尾检查每个节点\n3. **两种操作**：\n   - 节点 < pivot：留在原地（或者说在\"小于区\"）\n   - 节点 >= pivot：拔出来放到\"大于等于区\"的尾巴\n4. **完成**：所有小的在前，pivot 在中间，所有大的在后\n\n---\n\n## 下一步学习建议\n\n如果你想更深入理解：\n\n1. **手动模拟**：拿张纸画出链表，手动模拟几个例子\n2. **添加打印**：在代码里加 `std::cout`，看每一步的变化\n3. **尝试修改**：试着改变 pivot 的选择方式（比如选第一个而不是最后一个）\n4. **理解递归**：学习 partition 之后，看看 `quickSortRec` 函数如何递归调用\n\n---\n\n## 最后的鼓励\n\n链表和指针是 C++ 中比较难的概念，如果一开始不理解，完全正常！多读几遍，多画几个图，多运行几次程序，慢慢就会有\"啊哈！\"的顿悟时刻。\n\n编程是一项需要练习的技能，就像学骑自行车，刚开始可能会摔倒，但只要坚持，一定能掌握！\n\n加油！你已经在学习的道路上迈出了重要的一步。\n", "file_path": "/app/partition_function_guide.md"}}]}}

IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.\n\nContents of /app/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Repository Purpose\n\nThis repository contains a C++ implementation of the quicksort algorithm applied to singly-linked lists. It serves as an educational example demonstrating:\n- How to implement quicksort on linked list data structures\n- In-place partitioning without random access\n- Recursive sorting with pointer manipulation\n\n## Code Architecture\n\n**Single-file implementation**: `quick_sort_linked_list.cpp`\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **ListNode structure** (lines 4-9)\n   - Simple singly-linked list node with integer values\n   - Contains `val` and `next` pointer\n\n2. **Helper Functions**\n   - `printList()` (lines 12-21): Displays链表 in readable format\n   - `getTail()` (lines 24-29): Finds the tail node for pivot selection\n   - `createList()` (lines 106-120): Creates链表 from array\n   - `freeList()` (lines 123-129): Memory cleanup\n\n3. **Core Algorithm**\n   - `partition()` (lines 32-67): Lomuto partition scheme adapted for链表\n   - `quickSortRec()` (lines 70-98): Recursive quicksort implementation\n   - `quickSort()` (lines 101-103): Entry point with tail node detection\n\n4. **Test Cases** (lines 131-217)\n   - 5 comprehensive test scenarios in `main()`\n   - Tests: random arrays, sorted arrays, reverse arrays, duplicates\n\n## Common Commands\n\n### Build and Run\n```bash\n# Compile the program\ng++ -std=c++17 -o quick_sort quick_sort_linked_list.cpp\n\n# Run the executable\n./quick_sort\n\n# One-liner: compile and run\ng++ -std=c++17 -o quick_sort quick_sort_linked_list.cpp && ./quick_sort\n```\n\n### Development Notes\n\n- **C++ Standard**: Requires C++17 or later\n- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (iostream, random)\n- **No test framework**: Self-contained tests in `main()`\n- **No linting tools configured**: Manual code review recommended\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Algorithm Characteristics\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case\n- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for recursion stack\n- **Partition Strategy**: Uses tail node as pivot\n- **Stability**: Not stable (relative order of equal elements not preserved)\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n- Pivot selection: Always uses the tail node of the current sub链表\n- In-place reordering without creating new链表 nodes\n- Handles edge cases: empty链表, single element, all equal elements\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\n/Users/guangnian/code/demo_claude/\n├── quick_sort_linked_list.cpp    # Source code (220 lines)\n├── quick_sort                    # Compiled executable\n└── CLAUDE.md                     # This file\n```\n\n### User Constraints\nDo not use emoji\n\nNo additional directories, build configurations, or documentation files exist.\n\n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.\n</system-reminder>\n"}, {"type": "text", "text": "我是一个刚学编程的新手，请用最友好、最生动有趣的方式帮我解释一下这个项目中的 partition 函数是怎么工作的，生成一个文档说明一下"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "thinking", "thinking": "用户希望我用友好、生动有趣的方式解释 partition 函数的工作原理，并生成一个文档。\n\n首先，我需要读取代码文件来了解 partition 函数的具体实现。\n\n根据 CLAUDE.md，partition 函数在 lines 32-67，文件是 quick_sort_linked_list.cpp。\n\n用户说\"不要用emoji\"，所以我需要避免使用任何表情符号。\n\n让我先读取文件，然后用友好易懂的方式解释这个函数。", "signature": "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"}, {"type": "text", "text": "我来帮你理解 partition 函数！首先让我读取一下代码，然后用最容易理解的方式为你解释。"}, {"type": "tool_use", "id": "toolu_012aaDQi7XaJr5WnojBeUMQB", "name": "Read", "input": {"file_path": "/app/quick_sort_linked_list.cpp"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"tool_use_id": "toolu_012aaDQi7XaJr5WnojBeUMQB", "type": "tool_result", "content": "     1→#include <iostream>\n     2→#include <random>\n     3→\n     4→// 链表节点结构\n     5→struct ListNode {\n     6→    int val;\n     7→    ListNode* next;\n     8→    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}\n     9→};\n    10→\n    11→// 辅助函数：打印链表\n    12→void printList(ListNode* head) {\n    13→    while (head != nullptr) {\n    14→        std::cout << head->val;\n    15→        if (head->next != nullptr) {\n    16→            std::cout << \" -> \";\n    17→        }\n    18→        head = head->next;\n    19→    }\n    20→    std::cout << std::endl;\n    21→}\n    22→\n    23→// 辅助函数：获取链表尾节点\n    24→ListNode* getTail(ListNode* head) {\n    25→    while (head != nullptr && head->next != nullptr) {\n    26→        head = head->next;\n    27→    }\n    28→    return head;\n    29→}\n    30→\n    31→// 链表快速排序辅助函数：分区操作\n    32→ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, ListNode* end, ListNode** newHead, ListNode** newEnd) {\n    33→    ListNode* pivot = end;\n    34→    ListNode* prev = nullptr;\n    35→    ListNode* cur = head;\n    36→    ListNode* tail = pivot;\n    37→\n    38→    while (cur != pivot) {\n    39→        if (cur->val < pivot->val) {\n    40→            // 当前节点小于pivot，移动到前面\n    41→            if (*newHead == nullptr) {\n    42→                *newHead = cur;\n    43→            }\n    44→            prev = cur;\n    45→            cur = cur->next;\n    46→        } else {\n    47→            // 当前节点大于等于pivot，移动到pivot后面\n    48→            if (prev) {\n    49→                prev->next = cur->next;\n    50→            }\n    51→            ListNode* temp = cur->next;\n    52→            cur->next = nullptr;\n    53→            tail->next = cur;\n    54→            tail = cur;\n    55→            cur = temp;\n    56→        }\n    57→    }\n    58→\n    59→    // 如果pivot是最小的元素\n    60→    if (*newHead == nullptr) {\n    61→        *newHead = pivot;\n    62→    }\n    63→\n    64→    *newEnd = tail;\n    65→\n    66→    return pivot;\n    67→}\n    68→\n    69→// 递归进行快速排序\n    70→ListNode* quickSortRec(ListNode* head, ListNode* end) {\n    71→    if (!head || head == end) {\n    72→        return head;\n    73→    }\n    74→\n    75→    ListNode* newHead = nullptr;\n    76→    ListNode* newEnd = nullptr;\n    77→\n    78→    ListNode* pivot = partition(head, end, &newHead, &newEnd);\n    79→\n    80→    // 如果pivot前面还有元素，继续排序\n    81→    if (newHead != pivot) {\n    82→        ListNode* temp = newHead;\n    83→        while (temp->next != pivot) {\n    84→            temp = temp->next;\n    85→        }\n    86→        temp->next = nullptr;\n    87→\n    88→        newHead = quickSortRec(newHead, temp);\n    89→\n    90→        temp = getTail(newHead);\n    91→        temp->next = pivot;\n    92→    }\n    93→\n    94→    // 排序pivot后面的部分\n    95→    pivot->next = quickSortRec(pivot->next, newEnd);\n    96→\n    97→    return newHead;\n    98→}\n    99→\n   100→// 快速排序主函数\n   101→void quickSort(ListNode** headRef) {\n   102→    *headRef = quickSortRec(*headRef, getTail(*headRef));\n   103→}\n   104→\n   105→// 辅助函数：从数组创建链表\n   106→ListNode* createList(const int arr[], int n) {\n   107→    ListNode* head = nullptr;\n   108→    ListNode* tail = nullptr;\n   109→    for (int i = 0;

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Claude Code (eg. \"can Claude Code do...\", \"does Claude Code have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Claude Code in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Claude Code (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or install an MCP server)\n- how to use the Claude Agent SDK, or asks you to write code that uses the Claude Agent SDK\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide' to get accurate information from the official Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read. If a user asks about or wants you to modify a file, read it first. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- \n- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it.\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.\n  - Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.\n  - Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.\n  - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task—three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.\n- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused `_vars`, re-exporting types, adding `// removed` comments for removed code, etc. If something is unused, delete it completely.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: Read for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, Edit for editing instead of sed/awk, and Write for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n\nYou can use the following tools without requiring user approval: Bash(pip install:*), Bash(python3 -m pip install:*), Bash(apt-get update:*), Bash(apt-get install:*), Bash(python3:*), Bash(curl:*), Bash(wget:*)\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /app\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.0-94-generic\nToday's date: 2025-12-27\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4.5.

Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}], "tools": [{"name": "Task", "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n- Plan: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"description": {"type": "string", "description": "A short (3-5 word) description of the task"}, "prompt": {"type": "string", "description": "The task for the agent to perform"}, "subagent_type": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of specialized agent to use for this task"}, "model": {"type": "string", "enum": ["sonnet", "opus", "haiku"], "description": "Optional model to use for this agent.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend.  ONLY use --amend when either (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook (additional instructions below) \n- Before amending: ALWAYS check authorship (git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry ONCE. If it succeeds but files were modified by the hook, verify it's safe to amend:\n   - Check authorship: git log -1 --format='%an %ae'\n   - Check not pushed: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\"\n   - If both true: amend your commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit (never amend other developers' commits)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases.

You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.
